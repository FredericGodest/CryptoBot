## Principle
The algorithm is based on the moving average algorithm.
The first step of this algorithm is to create two curves :
* Short moving average curve (2 periods in this case)
* Long moving average curve (20 periods in this case)

The two moving average curves are based on the closing prices curve
on the given period (1 day or 1 hour).
When the short moving average curve is crossing 
the long moving average curve by the **bottom** then it is time to buy stocks.
When the short moving average curve is crossing 
the long moving average curve by the **top** then it is time to buy stocks.

In this case, we find out that the moving average combinason 2/20 seems to
be optimized for cryptocurrency.
